# Evaluation of masonry structures subject to subsidence processes

Due to the topological and geological nature of the Netherlands many areas around the country suffer from poor soil resistance which makes construction and engineering of structures increasingly difficult. Moreover, soil characteristics change with time and in the case of the Netherlands more abruptly in comparison to other geographical locations and climates. Therefore, in thousands of cases around the country in different stages of a structure’s lifespan, the capacity required from the soil by structures has been insufficient. This has resulted in buildings undergoing settlements as a consequence of shallow subsidence phenomena. Masonry constitutes a nationally popular construction material in the Netherlands, particularly in the case of residential homes. Moreover, masonry structures are understood to be more prone to damage when they suffer changes in their structural equilibrium, this is commonly attributed to their hybrid composition and the plentiful locations for failure envelopes to develop along the discrete block interfaces in a masonry structure’s envelope. Therefore, throughout the Netherlands thousands of homes have seen their structural integrity compromised in the forms of cracks and distortions, which in some cases has led to the necessity to intervene in building’s foundation systems to prevent subsidence processes from compromising further the structure, whereas in many other extreme cases the only feasible course of action involved the demolition of the building. Therefore, efficient yet precise damage prediction to masonry structures due to subsidence, has the potential to preemptively determine the vulnerability of structures to eventually surpass their serviceability limit state and allow for the engineering of contermeasures to be implemented at times when intervention is still economically feasable. Therefore the tools in this repository aim to fulfull the following objective.

> This thesis will be focused on the analysis through analytical and numerical solutions, in the case of numerical solu-tions this refers to simulations that include the behaviour of the structure, and the soil being employed. In the case of analytical solutions, a different range of methods will be evaluated. The focus of the evaluation will be to deter-mine their capacity to correctly predict the amount and characteristics of the damage.

In the Netherlands it has been customary for engineering consultants to perform inspections in those buildings affected by subsidence phenomena. There assessment and investigation eventually takes form of a foundation assessment report. In this report the inspection and posterior assessment findings are presented, its contents usually include the archival information of the building (year of construction, major remodelations..). An extensive building damage documentation presented in the form of images indicating the severity and location of the damage sustained by the building, a  measurements campaign to quantify the distortions experienced by the building, usually taking the form of skew measurements at different locations in the building. And lastly, a simple soil exploration campaign to understand the capacity of the underneath soil and the location typology and dimensions of the foundation relative to the underneath strata.

## Breakdown of the 'bricks' module

Bricks is a in development module which aims to help engineers access easy to use tools 


'Ijsselsteinseweg 77.ipynb' is a exemplary notebook illustrating the assesment and visualisation tools available from 'bricks' in the analysis of a real wordl scenario.
