# Evluation of masonry structures subject to subsidence processes

Due to the topological and geological nature of the Netherlands many areas around the country suffer from poor soil resistance which makes construction and engineering of structures increasingly difficult. Moreover, soil characteristics change with time and in the case of the Netherlands more abruptly when compared to other geographical locations and climates. Therefore, in thousands of cases around the country and at different times throughout structure’s lifespans, the capacity required from the soil by structures has been insufficient, which has resulted in buildings undergoing settlements as a consequence of shallow subsidence phenomena. Masonry constitutes a nationally popular construction material in the Netherlands, particularly in the case of residential homes. Moreover, masonry structures are understood to be more prone to damage when they suffer changes in their structural equilibrium, this is commonly attributed to their hybrid composition and the plentiful locations for failure envelopes to develop along the discrete block interfaces in a masonry structure’s envelope. Therefore, throughout the Netherlands thousands of homes have seen their structural integrity compromised in the forms of cracks and distortions, which in some cases has led to the necessity to intervene in building’s foundation systems to prevent subsidence processes from compromising further the structure, whereas in many other extreme cases the only feasible course of action involved the demolition of the building. Therefore, efficient yet precise damage prediction to masonry structures due to subsidence, has the potential to preemptively determine the vulnerability of structures to eventually surpass their serviceability limit state and allow for the engineering of contermeasures to be implemented at times when intervention is still economically feasable.

> This thesis will be focused on the analysis through analytical and numerical solutions, in the case of numerical solu-tions this refers to simulations that include the behaviour of the structure, and the soil being employed. In the case of analytical solutions, a different range of methods will be evaluated. The focus of the evaluation will be to deter-mine their capacity to correctly predict the amount and characteristics of the damage.
